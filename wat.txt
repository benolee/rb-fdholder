(31)  Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay! The key to victory is
(32)  discipline, and that means a well made bed. You will practice until you can
(33)  make your bed in your sleep. I just told you! You've killed me!
(34)
(35)  Well I'da done better, but it's plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial
(36)  for that there incompetence. Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a
(37)  12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of
(38)  community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused.
(39)
(40)  Throw her in the brig. You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make
(41)  you work, but they don't pay you or let you go. Oh sure! Blame the wizards! Who
(42)  are you, my warranty?! The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well
(43)  made bed. You will practice until you can make your bed in your sleep.
(44)
(45)  Oh Leela! You're the only person I could turn to; you're the only person who
(46)  ever loved me. For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to
(47)  exist! Daddy Bender, we're hungry. You're going back for the Countess, aren't
(48)  you?
(49)
(40)  With gusto. Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk! I feel like I was mauled
(41)  by Jesus. What's with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food. Alright,
(42)  I'll get you some stupid food.
(43)
(44)  What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso! Meh.
(45)  Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged.
(46)  Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die like this. But I always really hoped.
